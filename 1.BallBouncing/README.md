Three.js Bouncy Ball
===================

![](https://raw.github.com/jhester/physical-simulation/master/1.BallBouncing/screen.png)
This contains a simple physics simulation of a bouncing ball inside of a rectangle. Shows how to use the Three.js libary for physical simulations.

Right now it onys uses Euler integration for movement, so it is fairly unstable except at low time steps.
