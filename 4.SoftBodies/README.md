Soft Bodies
===================

Incomplete implementation of soft body physics using GLSL shaders. Able to render volume meshses with up to 200,000 particles on regular GPU's.

Borrows approach from _Interactive Simulation of Deformable Bodies on GPUs_ and _Large Steps in GPU-based Deformable Bodies Simulation_.
